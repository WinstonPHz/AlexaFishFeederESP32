# AlexaFishFeederESP32
This is code that was written to move a motor using amazon Alexa, specifically for a fish feeder, but this could be used for any number of cool projects.  There is also LED functionallity. I will be uploading circuit board grbl files and pin outs at a later date, if you want to know these feel free to contact me.
